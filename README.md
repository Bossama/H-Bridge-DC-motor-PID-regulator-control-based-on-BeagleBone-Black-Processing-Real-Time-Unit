# H-Bridge-DC-motor-PID-regulator-control-based-on-BeagleBone-Black-Processing-Real-Time-Unit


H-Bridge design and DC motor control with PID implementation based on the BeagleBone Black PRU-ICSS (Programmable Real-time Unit and Industrial Communication Sub-System)

Design a H-Bridge with IRF840 MOSFET which can drive DC motors up to 400 Volts and 8 amperes at high frequency (20KHz).
Generate a PWM signal from the BeagleBone Black PRU*, in order to change the motor speed and read the current speed from an incremental encoder (speed sensor) by the PRU eCAP module with one millisecond (1ms) sampling period.

 Enhance the job with the implementation of a digital PID regulator and fixing the Kp, Ki and Kd parameters with the Zieglerâ€“Nichols method.
 
Finishing the project by creating a graphic user interface IHM using GTK library.



program files will uploading soon...
